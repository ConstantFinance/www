# Term of Use

Updated 21 Nov 2024

## 1. **Welcome to [constfi.com](http://constfi.com/) and the Interface!**

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the constfi.com website ("Constfi.com") and any associated platforms, interfaces, or services (collectively referred to as the "Services"). The Services are brought to you by the constant finance ("we," "us," or "our").

Constfi.com provides access to information and services related to decentralized finance, focusing on constant interest rate protocols powered by smart contracts deployed on public blockchain networks. While we provide a platform for accessing and interacting with these protocols, we do not control or operate any underlying blockchain networks.

The Interface facilitates interactions between users and blockchain-based protocols through third-party self-custodial wallets. It is essential to understand that using the Interface requires compliance with these Terms.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE:** THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN DISPUTES, YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL ISSUES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION, WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR PARTICIPATION IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT.

**Binding Agreement:** By accessing or using our Services, including constfi.com, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy ("Agreement"). If you disagree, you must not use the Services.

## 2. **Services**

[Constfi.com](http://constfi.com/) serves as a platform for accessing constant interest rate financial protocols. While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date resources, the information available is for informational purposes only. It should not be relied upon as financial, legal, or professional advice.

**Users retain full control of their assets:**

When interacting with the Services, you maintain full control and custody of your digital assets. We do not hold, store, or have access to your funds. Transactions are executed directly on the underlying blockchain via your self-custodial wallet.

**Wallet connections are third-party services:**

Your connection to the blockchain requires a self-custodial wallet provided by third-party entities. These wallets operate under their terms and conditions, separate from Const.

**Decentralized transactions:**

[Constfi.com](http://constfi.com/) acts as an informational resource and does not mediate, process, or interfere with transactions on the blockchain. All interactions occur independently via smart contracts, and we do not act as intermediaries or custodians.

**Blockchain fees:**

Blockchain transactions may require gas fees paid directly to the network. These fees are non-refundable and outside our control.

## 3. **Assumption of Risk**

By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with blockchain technology and decentralized finance:

- **Experimental Technology:** Smart contracts, blockchain protocols, and decentralized systems are new and subject to risks, including bugs, malfunctions, and cyberattacks.
- **Irreversible Transactions:** Blockchain transactions are final and cannot be reversed.
- **Third-Party Risks:** We are not responsible for the content or services provided by third-party wallets, protocols, or platforms. Use of these services is at your own risk.
- **Security:** You are solely responsible for securing your self-custodial wallet and private keys. Loss of access to your wallet may result in permanent loss of funds.

We assume no liability for any losses incurred due to the use of blockchain networks or associated technologies.

## 4. **Taxes**

You are solely responsible for determining and paying any taxes, duties, or assessments that may apply to your use of the Services, including gains or transactions involving digital assets. Blockchain-based financial transactions are subject to varying tax treatments across jurisdictions, and you are encouraged to consult with a tax professional to ensure compliance with applicable laws.

## 5. **Ownership**

**License to use the Services:**

We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use our Services, provided you comply with these Terms.
