# Overview

Constant is a decentralized, self-custodial matching protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers for lending.

Suppliers provide assets with a preferred interest rate to the market and earn yield. Borrowers can access these assets at matched interest rates by providing collateral that exceeds the borrowed amount.
