# Refinance

Every loan within the Const Protocol has a specified lending term.

After the loan matures, the borrower can request a loan extension, which involves selecting the most favorable interest rate available in the current market, borrowing new funds to repay the existing debt, while also assessing the health of the collateral. In this way, the borrower can achieve indefinite borrowing.
