# Repay

Repaying borrowed tokens in the Const Protocol is an important step in asset management. Borrowers can repay using the same tokens they borrowed.

Repayment increases the collateralization ratio, ensuring adequate coverage and helping prevent liquidation. By boosting the collateral relative to what was borrowed, repayment protects assets from being liquidated and allows borrowers to safely withdraw a portion of their collateral.

Repayment typically occurs after the loan reaches maturity. A 24-hour grace period is provided following the maturity of the lending.
