# Matching protocol

Const is a matching protocol for digital asset lending, based on a set of smart contracts running on EVM-compatible blockchains and networks. The Const Protocol enables users to supply their assets to earn, and it also allows other participants to borrow those assets using their own collateral.

The matching feature allows suppliers and borrowers to select the interest rate, lending terms, and other parameters themselves. If a supplier’s acceptable interest rate is equal to or lower than a borrower’s acceptable rate, the lending relationship is established. This gives suppliers and borrowers the flexibility of an unlimited interest rate range and more.

The Const Protocol is self-custodial, which means users don’t need to keep their digital assets locked in any smart contracts or pools after the lending relationship ends. Assets return directly to users’ wallets, ensuring a higher level of asset safety.
