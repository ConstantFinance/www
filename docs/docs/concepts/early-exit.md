# Early exit

During the term of a Const lending agreement, participants have the option to quit the lending relationship prior to its scheduled maturity.

If borrowers choose to exit the agreement early, they are required to repay the outstanding principal along with all accrued interest in full.

If a lender wishes to exit early, they can sell their position at a discount or premium to the remaining interest and list the loan on a secondary market for manual replacement. This provides a flexible way to secure a suitable replacement, ensuring the loan continues to be serviced effectively.
