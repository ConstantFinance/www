# Supply

Supplying tokens to the Const Protocol enables users to earn interest on their digital assets. When tokens are supplied, an acceptable interest rate and lending term are set. The Const system continuously seeks to match borrowers and establish lending relationships as quickly as possible. It also displays a recommended interest rate to help facilitate rapid lending.

The interest rates for supplied tokens in the Const Protocol are typically higher than those in variable-rate protocols. This is because the interest rates are set by the suppliers themselves, with no rate loss due to borrow utilization ratios.
